# Health Management Organization - Health Cost analysis
The overall goal of the case is to provide actionable insights, based on the data available, as well as accurately predict which people (customers) will be expensive. The dataset contains healthcare cost information from an HMO (Health Management Organization). Each row in the dataset represents a person. To understand the key drivers for why some people are more expensive (i.e., require more health care), as well as predict which people will be expensive (in terms of health care costs).

# Goals:
• Predict people who will spend a lot of money on health care next year (i.e., which people will have high healthcare costs). • Provide actionable insight to the HMO, in terms of how to lower their total health care costs, by providing a specific recommendation on how to lower health care costs.

Leveraged advanced data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis, mapping visualizations, and machine learning algorithms. Applied statistical modeling and predictive analytics to develop accurate models for predicting high-cost individuals.
Utilized R programming language to perform data manipulation, statistical analysis, and create visualizations.
Employed feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information from the healthcare cost dataset and determined actionable insights and one specific recommendation for lowering healthcare costs.
Utilized R programming language to perform data manipulation, statistical analysis, and create visualizations.
